 Write a program for the problem: the array of inetegers indicating the marks of the students is given, U have to calculate the percentile of the students aaccording to this rule: the percentile of a student is the %of no of student having marks less then him. 
For eg: suppose

Student Marks
A 12
B 60
C 80
D 71
E 30
F 45

Solution-

Marks = list(map(int, input().split()))
output =[]

for items in Marks:
    percentile = 0
    count = 0
    for i in Marks:
        if i<items:
            count = count +1
    percentile = (count*100)//(len(Marks) -1)
    output.append(percentile)
    
print(output)
